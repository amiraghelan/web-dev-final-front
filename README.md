## Overview

Awesome Shop allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, manage their profile, and (for admins) manage the product catalog. The app uses React Context for state management, SCSS for styling, and includes responsive design for all devices.

## Features

### Authentication
- Users can register and log in.
- Authentication state is managed globally.
- Displays clear messages for login success or failure.
- Authentication is implemented via sessionStorage so that closing browser tab will log user out but refreshing is fine. (The Shop is really secure :) ) 

### Product Catalog
- Browse a list of products with prices and sale indicators.
- View detailed information for each product, including stock and description.
- Clear visual indecator for products that are out of stok.
- Users can brows the shop but need to login to be able to add products to cart and this flow will be prompted to user via tooltips and other visual indecators.

### Shopping Cart
- Add products to the cart from the product list or detail page.
- Edit product quantities or remove items directly from the cart.
- Cart total is calculated automatically and updates in real time.

### Order Finalization
- Users can proceed to finalize their order (currently navigates to a "Coming Soon" page).

### Profile Management
- Users can view and update their profile information.
- Address management is available for users.

### Admin Panel
- Admin users can add, edit, or delete products.
- Admin-only routes are protected and hidden from regular users.

### Protected Routes
- Certain pages (profile, admin) are only accessible to logged-in users.

### Responsive Design
- The application is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Notifications
- Success and error notifications are displayed using `react-toastify` for a better user experience.
